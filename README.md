If you like blockchain technology you are at the right place. My name is Rene and I work on blockchain projects for multiple years. For example, I created a proof of concept how to use Personal identity cards and blockchain technology to allow a voting process where you can verify the vote result yourself (see my featured section).

I like to collaborate on blockchain projects, zero knowledge proofs, and WASM.
